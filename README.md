# stockmarketsim
a stock market simulator (terminal based) made in python


buy stocks. sell them. simple as that.

make money, buy houses to make more money (don't ask), and then beat the game by taking a flight to hawaii that costs 1 billion dollars for vacation, where you'll launch into space and live on the moon (to be covered in the sequelâ„¢)
